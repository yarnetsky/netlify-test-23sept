<b>Out of an abundance of caution and in following the recommendations of President Crawford, Governor DeWine, and state public health officials to minimize non-essential group gatherings, <u>the Miami University Digital Humanities Forum​ has been postponed</u>. We sincerely appreciate your understanding as we take steps to ensure the continued wellbeing of all our Miami community.</b>

On Monday, April 6, the Miami University Libraries and the Humanities Center will welcome Miami faculty, students and staff from across academic disciplines to the Miami University Digital Humanities Forum.

Participants will join in conversation over breakfast and lunch, and engage in a series of workshops and conversations about digital humanities at Miami. No prior experience with digital humanities is required to register, and those curious about digital methodologies are encouraged to attend.
