<p>Need some inspiration on a Valentine’s gift? Have a gift in mind but need some resources, tools or expert advice?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Come Craft Your Heart Out on Friday, Feb. 7, 2020 in the University Libraries Makerspace. Located on the third floor of King Library, the Makerspace is open to all Miami students, faculty and staff. This event is planned a week before Valentine’s Day to give you plenty of time to explore, create and even come back if you need more time to innovate before the big day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From 1- 5 p.m., the Makerspace will host crafts including card making, blackout poetry, button making, heat transfer to tote bags, and light-up felt brooches.&nbsp;</p>
