        <h2>A Farewell to BEST</h2>

        <p>After nearly a decade of serving Miami University’s Oxford campus, B.E.S.T. Library is permanently closing in
            Laws Hall.</p>

        <p>The majority of its books, journals, and other physical materials will remain in the basement of Laws Hall
            for the foreseeable future, where Libraries staff can retrieve them for students, faculty, and staff as
            needed. The most frequently-accessed parts of the collection will move to King Library, as will all other
            services and staff.</p>

        <p>Consolidation of services and staff emerged as a major theme of the Libraries’ Master Plan developed in 2017.
            As emerging university programs continue to grow — and since measures to safeguard the community from the
            covid-19 pandemic require additional classroom space — the Libraries see an opportunity to progress toward
            its strategic facilities plan while also supporting the needs of the campus as a whole.</p>

        <p>Students, faculty, and staff can request items held in the basement of Laws Hall through the Libraries’
            website and pick them up at either King Library, Amos Music Library, or Wertz Art and Architecture Library
            this fall when they reopen to the Miami community.</p>
