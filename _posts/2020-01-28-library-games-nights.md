<p>Library Games Nights are a series of four evenings that rotate between the different library locations on campus. This event welcomes the Oxford community as well as Miami students, faculty, staff and their families.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>No other place on campus</h3>

<p>"Library Games Nights are incredibly receptive to everyone,” said Oliver Miller ‘21,&nbsp; mechanical engineering student and president of the Strategy Gaming Club student organization. Miller continued to describe the games night as welcoming “regardless of your board game experience. There is no other place on campus where students, faculty, and families from the Oxford area all come together to share a mutual love for something like board games.”</p>

<h3>Find a Favorite&nbsp;</h3>

<p>With over a hundred games available, there is sure to be something for every participant. There will always be family games like Clue, Guess Who and Battleship. Student favorites include games like Splendor, Exploding Kittens and Ticket to Ride. Librarians have come to love Wingspan and Blood Rage. The games are provided through the Libraries’ games collection, which is available for checkout in the Instructional Materials Center (IMC) in King Library.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Old Friends and New Friends</h3>

<p>Starting in February, the Libraries will host one Games Night each month of the spring semester. Miller suggests, “if you get the opportunity, ask a few friends and check it out. You may end up finding a new passion and making lots of new friends, like I have!"</p>
