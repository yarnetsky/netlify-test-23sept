## Where are you originally from? What's your educational background?

I'm originally from the wild west, also known as Nevada. I grew up in Reno, Nevada and headed down to Las Vegas for my college education. My educational background is in hospitality, specifically in meetings and events management with a minor in entertainment management. Hospitality led me to Advancement and building engaging online alumni resources. The common thread throughout my education and work experience is people. Broad, I know, but this has translated into developing programs and people, building community, creating engaging environments, and delivering the highest level of customer service just like the Libraries.

## What's your title? How would you describe your position at the Miami Libraries?

I am a project management specialist here at the Libraries. I'm working with the leadership team on five specific projects over the next few months: leading the strategic planning process, assisting with the ARL assessment, working with diversity and sustainability initiatives, developing a student leadership academy, and more.

## What drew you to work in a library environment?
Not only do I find the projects I’m working on exciting and impactful but was drawn to the focus on inclusion of all and access to information a library environment offers. Additionally, I believe in the value of innovation and collaborative partnerships and was excited this is also a priority of the Miami Libraries.

## What's the best part of working in a library?
Being surrounded by colleagues that have a genuine passion for the work they do. In addition, seeing how this translates to benefit the student experience and positive campus partnerships.

## What's one thing you wish college students knew about using a library?
It’s so much more than a great space to study and do research for a project or paper! Through the various workshops, programs, and initiatives the possibilities to achieve your goals, with the support of the Libraries, are endless.

## What are you most excited about tackling in your new role?
Can my answer be everything? I believe all of the projects I will be working on will result in a positive impact and meaningful forward momentum. I am currently most excited about the strategic planning process our entire community is a part of. We are building an actionable road map that will shape our services, define our priorities, and ensure the continued strength and relevancy of our university library system.

## What's your favorite book? What book character would you most like to be?
Oh man, my favorite book is a hard one to pick. My favorite most recent read was Educated by Tara Westover. I had the opportunity to see her speak at a conference in April 2018 and was captivated by her life experiences and the impact education has had on her life.

## Any hobbies?
Any outdoor adventure with our dog, Watson, yoga, and exploring new places are at the top of the hobbies list. (We’re new to this part of the country! I’m gladly accepting suggestions on things we must do in Ohio and the surrounding areas.)

## What's something people don't know about you that might surprise them?
I’m not sure how surprising this will be, but a life goal is to touch all 7 continents in my lifetime. Summer 2018 I hit my 4th continent with a trip to Africa. The trip also checked off another bucket list item: summitting Mt. Kilimanjaro. Let me tell you, the oxygen is, in fact, much better down here.
