Itâ€™s stressful out there. The beginning of a new semester. The general unease about the COVID crisis. Take a break with our Make Along virtual events. Share the below calendar with friends or look forward to meeting someone new. We welcome you to be curious and creative using materials you most likely already have in your house.

Creating is an important activity to reduce stress but also builds skills that will help your academic projects. [The Makerspace]((/use/spaces/makerspace/)) is hosting three Make Along events on the first Friday of each month. In September we will create cardboard triangle bookends, in October we will assemble paper chain wall hangings and we will end in November with tissue paper flowers. Each event will introduce you to a Makerspace team member who will not only demonstrate with step by step instructions but also be available to problem solve through any of your questions.

The Makerspace is a hands-on, highly collaborative, and experiential learning space. The Makerspace is now open on the third floor of King library on <span style="color:#C3142D">Monday - Friday, 9 a.m. - 4 p.m. for appointment-only use.<span>

Reserve time via this link or at the kiosk outside the Makerspace doors. Appointment Reservation: [https://muohio.libcal.com/reserve/equipment/makerspace](https://muohio.libcal.com/reserve/equipment/makerspace)
