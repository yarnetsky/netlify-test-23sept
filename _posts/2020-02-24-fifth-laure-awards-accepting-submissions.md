Submissions are now open for the Miami University Libraries Award for Undergraduate Research Excellence (LAURE). The LAURE recognizes and rewards students for their research conducted using library resources. This year, students are eligible to win a cash prize of $950 for first place or $300 for second place.

The submission deadline is March 15.  Entries require an essay detailing the student’s research strategies and use of library tools, resources, and services. Submission of a bibliography and project files are also required. A committee of faculty, librarians, and staff evaluate the submissions.

Students who have a research project they are working on as part of a credit-bearing course are eligible to apply. Faculty are encouraged to invite students to apply. Non-traditional research projects such as digital scholarship or maker projects are also welcome.

Ellen Strenstrom ‘19 won first prize in the LAURE last year, earning her a cash prize from the Libraries and recognition from the President and Provost at the Undergraduate Research Forum. In the video above, Ellen talks about her process of using library resources in writing her LAURE submission. Her essay, [“Reconsidering the Unreliability and Treatment of Mentally Ill Narrators”](https://sc.lib.miamioh.edu/handle/2374.MIA/6421) — along with all the essays from previous award winners — can be found on the [Miami University Scholarly Commons](https://sc.lib.miamioh.edu/) part of the [Undergraduate Sponsored Research and Scholarship Collection](https://sc.lib.miamioh.edu/handle/2374.MIA/5059).
