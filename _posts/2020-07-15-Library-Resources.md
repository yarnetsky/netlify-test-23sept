<h2>Library resources make it easy to incorporate information literacy and research skills into in-person, hybrid, or remote learning courses</h2>

<p>The University Libraries offer a number of resources for faculty&nbsp;to enhance their courses this semester. Whether it's in-person, fully remote, or somewhere in between, every class benefits from the materials, services, and other resources found at the Libraries. To help instructors support students in the research process, the Libraries have prepared in-depth subject guides,&nbsp;instructional videos, Canvas Commons modules, and a comprehensive set of&nbsp;information literacy resources through Credo Instruct. These resources give students the tools and knowledge to find and evaluate sources, identify industry-leading&nbsp;journals and databases, navigate the technical hurdles of managing citations, and find assistance from their subject librarian.</p>

<p>Miami University librarians produce and maintain <a href="https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/?b=s">subject guides</a> with library resources to aid research in each discipline. Adding subject guides to your course not only helps students locate books and articles, but also gives them an easy way to <a href="https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/about/organization/staff/">schedule an appointment with the subject librarian</a> for an in-depth research consultation.</p>
