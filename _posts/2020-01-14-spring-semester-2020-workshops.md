<h2>Spring workshops offer digital resources for success</h2>

<p><em>By Shawn Vanness, communications specialist</em></p>

<p>The Libraries are back from winter break with two free workshops designed to support student success. <em>Apps for Academic Success</em> and <em>Digital Wellness</em>&nbsp;offer tools for students to navigate and leverage emerging technologies.</p>

<p>Both workshops are open to all Miami students, faculty and staff. Students are welcome to drop in to any session. Charge up your mobile device and get ready for a great semester!</p>
